History of changes in basic
1. create the repo GITHUB
2. add a readme in GITHUB
3. GIT -- create a directory,  clone the GITHUB repo
    the tracking directory for main is created
4. GIT create this file in main
5. create the access token.  Mine is good for 90 days, I think.  I used the windows credential manager that popped up when I tried to use the web sign on.  No web is needed.  After using the token it gets added to the windows credential manager -- windows credentials.
Let's save this file.  Expect the push to work without entering a token.
